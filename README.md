# IS1200-datorteknik-KTH-Flappy-Bird-pic32
IS1200 simple project, flappy bird but instead of a bird it is a moving cat, all requirements for an A-project were fulfilled except random obstacles which can be implemented easily. 
A lot of the code was given to us by the teacher, and is not written by us. However every other line of code added is authentic and written by Sam Khosravi and Robert Minasyan.
